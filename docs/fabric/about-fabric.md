# About Fabric

Enterprise information systems do not stand alone. They connect with other systems, connect to databases, make rest calls, use queues, access file systems. 

During the development cycle an information system is often deployed in different __environments__.  

Fabric is a server that provides an environment for the system under test to run into.
